The expected advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has triggered a large demand of embedded devices, which envisions the autonomous interaction of these sensors and actuators while offering all sort of smart services. However, these IoT devices are limited in compute, storage, and network capacity which makes them easy to hack and compromise. To achieve a safe development of IoT, it is necessary to develop scalable security solutions optimized for the IoT ecosystem. To this end, Software Defined Networks (SDN) is a promising paradigm proposed in 5G that could help to detect and mitigate Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. In this article, we propose an experimental evaluation of an entropy-based solution to detect and mitigate DoS attacks in different scenarios. Results show the effectiveness of this mechanism. The proposed test beds have been conducted by using real data flows, in order to validate the solution under authentic IoT traffic.
